# Code Reviews

## Why?

We use code reviews to improve code quality and collaboration. Code reviews are opportunities to learn from one another and to share knowledge about our products.

## How?

We use GitHub Pull Requests for reviews. Anyone can review any code and we usually request review for the entire `Developer` team on GitHub.

Someone (or more than one) will pick that up and review it. For non trivial PRs it is advised to sit together and go over the changes.

## Tools

Check out the [Better Pull Request for GitHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-pull-request-for-g/nfhdjopbhlggibjlimhdbogflgmbiahc) for improving the GitHub PR experience (developed here at Torii).
