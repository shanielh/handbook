# QA without QA

> our job is not to code
> our job is not to test
> we are software engineers
> we SHIP software that SOLVES problems

## Why?

Good things happen when responsibility for products quality is not taken away from engineers. Engineers have the full power to code automated tests and use best practices for ensuring repeatable high quality.
